# Full Stack Open 2022

This course is offered by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki, in 2022.

It provides as an introduction to the use of JavaScript in contemporary web application development. The primary focus is on using ReactJS to create single-page applications that employ Node.js-built REST APIs.

This course also covers GraphQL, a cutting-edge substitute for REST APIs. Additionally, testing, setup and environment management, and the usage of MongoDB to store the data for the application are all included. This year edition also includes a section on TypeScript, React Native, CD/CD, Containers and Using of relational databases. My answers to the exercises from this course can be found in this repository.
